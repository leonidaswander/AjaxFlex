Js global function for ajax


After informing a class for its action button 'form_send_bt', inform your <form> the 'action' and an 'id' and you're done.

For fields with mandatory completion, simply add the 'required' tag to the message that will be displayed if the field is blank add the required_message tag and the text to be displayed:

Ex: 
<input type="text" id="my_name" required required_message = "Wooo, please this field is required my friend">

Note: All fields must have an 'id'
